<p>This show features one of the best plots in anime history, masterfully crafted by <br> 
Hajime Isayama. The series initially began as a show about humankind fighting <br>
titans. However, as the story progressed, themes such as violence, discrimination,<br>
politics, and freedom emerged within a much deeper, more complex, and twisted plot.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>

<p>This film, released in 2021, created lots of nostalgia for us young adults by bringing all<br>
3 spider mans from different dimensions into one movie.</p>

</ul>
<p>Its simple. They took the best things of all of the Spider-Man films and packed them<br> 
together neatly. No unnecessary filler, no overexplanation. Just put the pieces thereand<br> 
let the players do their thing.</p>
<h4>Moral/Theme</h4>
<p>Before making major decisions, think things through, write down your options,<br>
consider your options, discuss the with other people and consider the consequences.<br>
Plan things carefully so that both you and anyone helping you know all the facts before<br> 
taking any drastic action.</p>
